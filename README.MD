Nino's Future is an open source game coded to learn how to use the common Cocos2d-X features

The Windy library built on top of Cocos2d-X can be of help to create games that share similar mechanics with games such as Mario or Mega Man.

It currently features transitions, stage select, 4 fully playable levels with bosses and an item collection mechanic used to unlock the most powerful armor in the game.

There are more plans on this, RC 1.3 is the latest stable version and has the entire game fully functional and
will stay as the Mega Man tribute, departing from that version, we will create a different gameplay to make it
a signature game.

To edit the game assets you'll need Texture Packer and Physics Editor.

Support is welcomed, we plan migrating to Cocos version 3.17.1, as it's the latest UWP version supported.
